# Butterfly Effect
Developped in C# using Unity. This game was created as an entry to Mcgill's game jam of 2020. The theme was unintended consequences. This was my first ever gamejam. I was the artist for this gamejam but I also had to help/teach my friends Unity before and during the event!

## But every time you flap your wings you create a gust of wind that makes going back and forth increasingly harder.

## Go too low and you'll die in the thorny vines.

## But go too high and you'll drift off into space.
