# Butterfly Effect
This game was developed in C# using Unity as an entry to Mcgill University's 2020 Game Jam. The theme was “unintended consequences.” This was my first ever game jam. I taught my teammates how to code in Unity before and during the event! And, I coded part of the game and created the vector-art sprites (Adobe Illustrator).


## The goal is to flap your wings and get to the other flower.

## But every time you flap your wings you create a gust of wind that makes going back and forth increasingly harder.

## Go too low and you'll die in the thorny vines.

## But go too high and you'll drift off into space.
